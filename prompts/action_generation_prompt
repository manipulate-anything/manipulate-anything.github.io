Background: You are an AI in robot simulation code and task generation. I will provide you some examples of task primitive actions written in code based on their corresponding current image frame.
Task: Generate the elif condition for the new given primitive action of "close" given the current state (in the form of an image). Then, you will help me generate the code snippet for the elif condition to execute the primitive action. The output should only be the elif condition code snippet
=========
Example primitivate action: 'retract'

Example elif code for the above task primitives:

elif state == 'retract':
            action = obs['gripper_matrix']
            action[:3, 3] = action[:3, 3] - 0.2 * action[:3, 2]
            gripper_open = obs['gripper_open']
            message = 'Retract'
            pred = gripper_pose_from_rlbench(action)
            trans = action[:3, 3]
            rot = obs['gripper_pose'][3:]
=========
or
=========
Example primitive action: 'sweep'

Example elif code for the above task primitives:

elif state == 'sweep':
    action = obs['gripper_matrix']
    gripper_open = 0  # Ensure the gripper remains closed
    # Handle special conditions if the previous state was also 'sweep'
    if self.prev_state == 'sweep':
        # Special handling code here (if needed)
        pass

    # Adjust translation for sweeping action
    # Assuming the sweeping is along the x-axis or y-axis
    sweep_direction = 'x'  # or 'y', based on the task requirement
    sweep_amount = 0.1  # Define this in the configuration

    if sweep_direction == 'x':
        action[0, 3] += sweep_amount  # Modify x-coordinate for sweeping along x-axis
    elif sweep_direction == 'y':
        action[1, 3] += sweep_amount  # Modify y-coordinate for sweeping along y-axis

    # Keeping the rotation constant
    pred = gripper_pose_from_rlbench(action)
    trans = action[:3, 3]
    rot = obs['gripper_pose'][3:]  # Rotation remains unchanged

=========
or
=========
Example primitivate action: 'rotate'

Example elif code for the above task primitives:

elif state == 'rotate':
            action = obs['gripper_matrix']
            gripper_open = 0  # Ensure the gripper remains closed

            # Quaternion for 45-degree yaw rotation
            angle_z = np.radians(-60)
            cos_half_angle = np.cos(angle_z / 2)
            sin_half_angle = np.sin(angle_z / 2)
            rotation_quaternion = [cos_half_angle, 0, 0, sin_half_angle]  # Quaternion for rotation around the z-axis

            # Apply the new transformation to the gripper
            pred = gripper_pose_from_rlbench(action)
            trans = action[:3, 3]
            rot = self.quaternion_multiply(obs['gripper_pose'][3:], rotation_quaternion)

=========
New primitive action: 'close'
Objective: Rotate and translation to close a lip
Note:
- You can alternate translation via this line:
trans = action[:3, 3]
- You can alternate rotation via this line:
rot = obs['gripper_pose'][3:]

```

*No necessary text in the output and just write out all code with the elif condition only.
