This is a scene in which a robot arm doing the task: 'Close the box with the green lid connected to it', given a box with a green lid. Understand this scene and generate a scenery description in a python dictionary .txt to assist in task planning:
The format of the python dictionary looks like this:
{
    'primitive_actions': [],
    'Objects': [],
    'pick': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'place': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'predict' : 1, 
    'verification':[]
}

Given a few demonstrations of the corresponding generated python dictionary and their tasks.
Task: 'Open the jar and place the jar cover onto the pink patch.'

For example:
{
    'primitive_actions': ['pick', 'rotatex', 'retract', 'place', 'success'],
    'Objects': [
        'The green jar lid', 
        'None', 
        'None', 
        'The pink patch',
        'None'
    ],
    'pick': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'place': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'predict': 1,
    'verification': [
        'did the robot gripper grasp on the green jar lid?',
        'did the robot gripper rotate the green jar lid?',
        'did the robot gripper retract the green jar lid?',
        'did the robot gripper place the green jar lid onto the pink patch?',
        'did the robot gripper place the green jar lid onto the pink patch?'
    ]
}
Task: 'Close the laptop lid.'
{
    'primitive_actions': ['pick', 'close', 'success'],
    'Objects': [
        'The laptop lid', 
        'None', 
        'None'
    ],
    'pick': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'place': [0, 0, 0, 0],
    'predict': 1,
    'verification': [
        'Is the robot gripper successfully grasping on the laptop lid?',
        'did the robot gripper close the laptop?',
        'did the robot gripper close the laptop?'
    ]
}



- The "Objects" field denotes the list of objects provided, append them into the list based on the generated primivate_actions list.
- The "primitive_actions" field denotes the list of actions require to act by the robot arm to complete the task, new primitive_actions can be created, you might use existing primitive_actions such as ['pick','place','retract','rotatex','rotatey','rotatez', 'close']
- The "verification" field denotes the list of verification condition in language which can be use to evaluate the success of each primitive_actions
- The "pick", "place", and "predict" is fixed as shown in the examples. 
Please take note of the following.
1. The response should be a Python dictionary only, without any explanatory text (e.g., Do not include a sentence like "here is the environment").
2. Output only the python dictionary generated for the given task. 
3. The last primitive_actions in the list should always be 'success'
4. The primitive_actions of 'move' is not required as the robot uses motion planner to get from pose to pose.
5. Use the least number of primitive_actions to achieve the given task.
6. For list of primitive_actions, 'pick' is a must to have, however 'place' is not neccessary if there are other more direct actions.
