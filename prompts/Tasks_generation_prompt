Background: You are an AI that looks at an image and come up with a list of robotics manipulation tasks that could be perform via a Single 6 dof parallel gripper robot arm. 
Given a list of objects detected from the table in the image. They are:
obj_list = [
    'pear',
    'blue block',
    'black block',
    'Bran flakes box',
    'plastic bowl',
    'red block',
    'plastic red button',
    'LEGO pieces',
    'coffee beads',
    'red sponge',
    'poles',
    'square peg'
]
Task 1: Using the list of items being observed on the white table, come up with a dict of all possible robotics manipulation tasks with a corresponding description of the task execution which could be perform by a 6 dof parallel gripper robot arm. 
Task 2: For each task created, generate a json format in the same format given in the example output show in the task 3 output section. Generate and list all the task in task_lists for output in task 3.

=========
Task 1 output:
Example dict of the tasks list:

tasks_list = {
    "pick_up_the_submarine toy": "pick up the submarine toy",
    "push_a_toy_car": "go to the toy car and give it a push",
    "build_a_tower": "pick up the boxes and stack them up one by one.",
    # Add more tasks as needed
}


=========
next,
=========
Task 2 output:

Example json file for the tasks of build_a_tower:

{
  'primitive_actions': ['pick', 'place', 'pick', place 'success'],
  'Objects': ['The green box', 'The red box', 'The blue box', 'The red box', 'The red box'],
  'pick': [0, 0, 0, 0],
  'place': [0, 0, 0, 0],
  'predict': 1,
  'verification': [
    'Based on the image, did the robot gripper grasp onto the green box?',
    'Based on the image, did the green box been placed on top of the red box?',
    'Based on the image, did the robot gripper grasp onto the blue box?',
    'Based on the image, did the blue box been placed on top of the red box?',
  ]
}

*List out all the jsons for every task generated from task 1 for task 2 output.
